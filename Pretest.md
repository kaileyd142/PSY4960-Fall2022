Welcome to the R portion of PSY4960! Your first in class assignment will be to complete the pre-test below. The goal of this assignment is to determine what **you already know** so that I can adjust course materials appropriately. To that end, please treat this as a closed-note assignment. You should complete this project on your own, without feedback from your peers. This assignment will be graded based on whether or not it is submitted, not based on accuracy.

1) Evaluate the following expressions: 

a) a.	3*4 + 5 
```{r 1a} 17

```

b) √(64) /5 + (3*7)
```{r 1b} 22.6

```

c) take the sum of 4 and 9 and then multiply by 7
```{r 1c} 91

```

2) Create variables that contain the following information: 

a) A variable that contains your favorite number
```{r q2a} I don't know

```

b) A vector of all numbers betwee 1 and 100
```{r q2b} I don't know

```

c) A vector of all odd numbers between 1 and 37
```{r q2c} I don't know

```

d)An object that contains the words younger and older repeated 5 times each 
```{r q2d} I don't know

```

e)A vector of every 5th number between 1 and 100
```{r q2e} I don't know

```

3) Evaluate the following logical statements:

a) 3 times 4 is not equal to 6 plus 7
```{r 3a} 3*4 =/= 6+7 true

```

b) 4 squared is greater than 3 and 5 is less than 9 
```{r 3b} sqr(4) > 3 and 5 < 9  False

```

c) 12 divided by 2 is less than 5 or 4 is greater than 3
```{r 3c}  12/2 < 5 or 4 > 3  True

```

4) Answer the following questions using the mtcars dataset

a) open the mtcars dataset 
```{r 4a} Opened in new tab

```

b) Describe the data that are present in this dataset
It is information about different models of cars

c) What kind of variable is present in the am column? How do you know? 
Some type of you have it or you don't because cars either have a 1 or a 0

d) how many observations are in this dataset? 
```{r 4d} 32

```

e) what is the mean of the miles per gallon column? 
```{r 4e} I don't know where to find the dataset

```

f) what is the standard deviation of the miles per gallon column? 
```{r 4f} I don't know where to find the dataset

```

g) Print the top of the dataset
```{r 4g} I don't know where to find the dataset

```

h) Summarize the whole dataset
```{r 4h} I don't know where to find the dataset

```

5) Use the mtcars dataset to accomplish the following:

a) Create a scatter plot of hp versus mpg
```{r 5a} I don't know where to find the dataset

```

b) Add a regression line to your scatter plot
```{r 5b} I don't know where to find the dataset

```

c) Create a bar graph with gear on the x axis. 
```{r 5c} I don't know where to find the dataset

```

d) Add color to your bar graph by including information about the am column. 
```{r 5d} I don't know where to find the dataset

```

6) Open the ChickWeight dataset
```{r 6} I don't know where to find the dataset

```

a) Create a dataset that contains only the data associated with Chick #2
```{r 6a} I don't know where to find the dataset

```

b) Make a line graph of time vs weight
```{r 6b} I don't know where to find the dataset

```

7. Open the diamonds dataset (in ggplot)
```{r 7} I don't know where to find the dataset

```

a) Create a data set that contains all diamonds with over 1.5 carats and an ideal cut
```{r 7a} I don't know where to find the dataset

```

b) How many diamonds have the clarity “VS1”?
```{r 7b} I don't know where to find the dataset

```

c) Graph carat by price in this new dataframe. Color by cut
```{r 7c} I don't know where to find the dataset

```
